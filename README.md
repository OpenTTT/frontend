## Bird eye's view

This is an Angular 7 application built on top of the default Angular template (`ng new ...`), 
making heavy use of [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io) components.

To get it running, you should only need to run the following command in this folder: 
`npm install && npm run serve`, given that you have npm installed. Then browse to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
